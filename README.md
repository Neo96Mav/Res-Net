# Res-Net
Res-Net Architecture is coded in Tensorflow with Keras
Fashion MNIST is used as the dataset
There are around 20 layers in the net, and it takes around a min per epoch on Tesla K80 GPU 
(This time figure is from the Amazon AWS server)
The model achieves 91.67% test accuracy in only 12 epochs
